# Code of Conduct

This project is committed to a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free community for everyone. We expect all participants to help us create a safe and positive experience for all contributors and users.

This Code of Conduct sets expectations for behavior, describes where it applies, explains how to report concerns, and outlines how maintainers will enforce it. It is informed by the Open Source Guides on codes of conduct and similar community standards.

## Our Pledge

We, as maintainers and contributors, pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or other protected characteristics.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful, considerate, and kind in all interactions
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being open to constructive feedback and gracefully accepting different viewpoints
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project
- Showing empathy and support toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, bullying, or discrimination of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, including sexualized language or imagery
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission (doxxing)
- Sustained disruption of community discussions, reviews, issues, PRs, or events
- Encouraging or assisting any of the above behaviors

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and community spaces, including but not limited to:

- This GitHub repository (issues, discussions, pull requests, code reviews)
- Project documentation, wikis, and comments
- Any official project-related communication channels (for example, our Discord server)
- Public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns:

1. Report privately via email to: [conduct@poixpixel.ahmadk953.org](mailto:conduct@poixpixel.ahmadk953.org)
2. If your concern involves a person who receives these reports, or you are uncomfortable reporting to that address, you may escalate to: [conduct-escalation@poixpixel.ahmadk953.org](mailto:conduct-escalation@poixpixel.ahmadk953.org)

What to include (if you can): a description of the incident, where and when it occurred, who was involved, links or screenshots if relevant, and your contact information. We will treat all reports seriously and as confidentially as possible.

Acknowledgement of receipt will typically occur within 72 hours. We may follow up with additional questions to understand the context and determine appropriate next steps.

If email is not feasible for you, you may alternatively open a private issue with minimal details requesting a maintainers’ contact, and we will move the conversation to a private channel. Please avoid posting sensitive details publicly.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. When a violation is reported or observed, maintainers will:

1. Review the report and gather relevant information (from reporters, participants, and public logs as applicable)
2. Determine a response that prioritizes safety and a constructive community environment
3. Communicate the outcome to the reporter (as appropriate), and document the decision

Possible corrective actions include, but are not limited to:

- Facilitation or mediation to resolve a misunderstanding
- A private or public warning with clarification of expectations
- Temporary suspension of participation (e.g., from issues/PRs/Discord)
- Removal from project spaces and a permanent ban in severe or repeated cases
- Reverting or locking disruptive content (issues, PRs, comments)

Maintainers will apply this Code of Conduct consistently and fairly. If you feel an action was taken in error or unfairly, you may appeal by replying to the enforcement communication or emailing the escalation contact above with additional context.

When legally required or when behavior presents an immediate threat of harm, we may notify appropriate service providers or authorities.

## Transparency

Where feasible, maintainers may publish periodic, anonymized summaries of enforcement actions to help the community understand how this Code of Conduct is applied. We will not publish information that could reveal the identity of reporters or involved parties without consent.

## Acknowledgments and Inspiration

This Code of Conduct was informed by:

- [Open Source Guides: “Your Code of Conduct”](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)
- The spirit of community standards such as the Contributor Covenant

Thank you for helping us make this community welcoming and respectful.
