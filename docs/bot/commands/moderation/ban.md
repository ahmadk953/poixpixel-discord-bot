# Ban Command

## Overview

The `/ban` command allows moderators to ban members from the server with optional temporary duration. Banned users are removed from the server and cannot rejoin unless unbanned.

## Command Details

### Permissions Required

* **User**: `BAN_MEMBERS` permission
* **Bot**: `BAN_MEMBERS` permission

### Command Syntax

```bash
/ban member:<@member> reason:<text> [duration:<time>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `member` | User | ✅ Yes | The member to ban |
| `reason` | String | ✅ Yes | The reason for the ban |
| `duration` | String | ❌ No | Ban duration (e.g., 5m, 1h, 7d, 30d). Leave blank for permanent |

## Features

### 1. **Temporary Bans**

Set an optional duration for automatic unban:

* Supports various time formats: `5m`, `1h`, `7d`, `30d`
* Automatically schedules unban at expiration
* Unban is handled by the bot automatically
* Tracked in moderation history

### 2. **Role Hierarchy Protection**

* Moderators cannot ban members with equal or higher roles
* Ensures proper permission structure
* Prevents abuse of moderation powers

### 3. **DM Notifications**

Banned users receive a DM containing:

* Server name
* Ban reason
* Duration (if temporary)
* Unban timestamp (if temporary)
* Server invite link (for temporary bans)

### 4. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**

* Records action in moderation history database
* Logs to configured audit channel
* Includes: moderator, target, reason, duration, timestamp
* Tracks active ban status

### 5. **Database Tracking**

Updates member record with:

* `currentlyBanned` flag set to true
* Full moderation history entry
* Duration and expiration tracking

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Permanent Ban

```bash
/ban member:@TrollUser reason:Repeated harassment and rule violations
```

Permanently bans the user. They cannot rejoin without an unban.

### Example 2: Temporary 7-Day Ban

```bash
/ban member:@SpamBot reason:Spamming advertisements duration:7d
```

Bans for 7 days. User is automatically unbanned after expiration.

### Example 3: Short Timeout Alternative

```bash
/ban member:@MinorOffender reason:Minor rule violation duration:1h
```

1-hour ban for minor offenses (consider using `/mute` for short timeouts instead).

### Example 4: Extended Ban

```bash
/ban member:@MajorViolator reason:Severe ToS violation duration:30d
```

30-day ban for serious violations.

## How It Works

1. **Permission Validation**:
   * Checks moderator has `BAN_MEMBERS` permission
   * Verifies moderator's role is higher than target's highest role
   * Ensures bot has permission to ban the target

2. **DM Notification**:
   * Attempts to send DM to user explaining the ban
   * Includes reason, duration (if any), and invite link (if temporary)
   * Failure to DM is logged but doesn't prevent the ban

3. **Execute Ban**:
   * Removes user from server immediately
   * Discord API ban action with reason

4. **Schedule Unban** (if temporary):
   * Calculates expiration timestamp
   * Schedules automatic unban using bot's scheduling system
   * Stored in database for persistence across restarts

5. **Database Updates**:
   * Adds entry to moderation history
   * Sets `currentlyBanned` flag
   * Records moderator, reason, timestamp, duration

6. **Audit Logging**:
   * Posts formatted embed to audit log channel
   * Includes all relevant details
   * Moderators and admins can review actions

## Duration Format

Accepted duration formats:

| Format | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `Xm` | X minutes | `30m` = 30 minutes |
| `Xh` | X hours | `12h` = 12 hours |
| `Xd` | X days | `7d` = 7 days |
| `Xw` | X weeks | `2w` = 14 days |

**Examples:**

* `5m` - 5 minutes
* `1h` - 1 hour
* `7d` - 7 days
* `2w` - 14 days

## Error Handling

The command handles various error scenarios:

* **Equal/Higher Role**: "You cannot ban a member with equal or higher role than yours."
* **Not Bannable**: "I do not have permission to ban this member."
* **DM Failure**: Logged but ban still proceeds
* **Database Error**: Reported to moderator

## Automatic Unban

For temporary bans:

1. Expiration time stored in database
2. Bot schedules unban task
3. At expiration:
   * User is unbanned via Discord API
   * Moderation history updated (`active` set to false)
   * Audit log entry created
   * `currentlyBanned` flag set to false

## Related Commands

* [Unban](unban.md) - Manually unban a user
* [Kick](kick.md) - Remove without ban (user can rejoin)
* [Mute](mute.md) - Timeout without removal
* [Warn](warn.md) - Issue warning without punishment
* [User Info](../utility/user-info.md) - View member's moderation history

## Configuration

Configure audit logging in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "auditLog": "AUDIT_CHANNEL_ID"
  },
  "serverInvite": "https://discord.gg/your-server"
}
```

## Best Practices

* **Always provide detailed reasons** - Helps with transparency and appeals
* **Use temporary bans first** - Start with 7d, escalate to permanent if needed
* **Document repeat offenders** - Use `/user-info` to check history
* **Consider alternatives** - Use `/mute` for minor offenses
* **Communicate with team** - Discuss major bans with other moderators
* **Review history** - Check if user has prior offenses

## Tips

* Temporary bans are ideal for cooling-off periods
* Permanent bans should be reserved for severe violations
* Always explain the ban reason clearly
* Keep your server invite link updated in config
* Users can appeal bans through modmail or other channels you set up
