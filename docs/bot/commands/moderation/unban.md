# Unban

## Overview

The `/unban` command removes a ban from a user, allowing them to rejoin the server. This is useful for appealed bans, temporary ban expirations, or correcting mistakes.

## Command Details

### Permissions Required

* **User**: `BAN_MEMBERS` permission
* **Bot**: `BAN_MEMBERS` permission

### Command Syntax

```bash
/unban userid:<user_id> reason:<text>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                                              |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `userid`  | String | ✅ Yes    | The Discord ID of the user to unban (17-19 digit number) |
| `reason`  | String | ✅ Yes    | The reason for unbanning the user                        |

## Features

### 1. **Manual Unban**

* Removes Discord ban manually
* User can rejoin with invite link
* Useful for appeals or corrections

### 2. **Validation**

* Checks if user is actually banned
* Provides helpful error messages
* Prevents unnecessary API calls

### 3. **Audit Trail**

* Logs unban action
* Records moderator and reason
* Updates moderation history

### 4. **Database Updates**

* Sets ban record to inactive
* Clears `currentlyBanned` flag
* Maintains full history

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Appeal Accepted

```bash
/unban userid:123456789012345678 reason:Appeal accepted after review
```

Unban user whose appeal was approved.

### Example 2: Ban Expired

```bash
/unban userid:123456789012345678 reason:Temporary ban period expired
```

Manually unban if automatic unban failed (usually handled automatically).

### Example 3: Mistaken Ban

```bash
/unban userid:123456789012345678 reason:Banned wrong user, correcting mistake
```

Quickly correct an accidental ban.

### Example 4: Second Chance

```bash
/unban userid:123456789012345678 reason:User has shown improvement, giving second chance
```

Unban user who has demonstrated positive change.

## How It Works

1. **Validation**:
   * Checks if user ID is valid
   * Verifies user is actually banned
   * Returns error if not banned
2. **Execute Unban**:
   * Calls Discord API to remove ban
   * Uses helper function `executeUnban()`
   * Removes ban from Discord
3. **Database Updates**:
   * Updates moderation history
   * Sets ban record `active` to false
   * Clears `currentlyBanned` flag
   * Records moderator and reason
4. **Audit Logging**:
   * Posts to audit log channel
   * Includes: moderator, user, reason
   * Timestamp of unban
5. **Confirmation**: Sends success message to moderator.

## Finding User IDs

Since banned users aren't in the server, you need their User ID:

### Method 1: Audit Log Channel

Check your audit log channel for the original ban - the embed shows the user ID.

### Method 2: Discord Audit Log

1. Go to Server Settings → Audit Log
2. Find the ban action
3. Copy the user ID from there

### Method 3: User Info

If you have the username and discriminator, you can sometimes find them via search (but this requires dev mode and right-click Copy ID).

### Method 4: Bot Database

Use `/user-info` command before they leave (if possible) or check database records.

## Error Handling

* **User Not Banned**: "This user is not banned."
* **Invalid User ID**: "Error getting ban. Is this user banned?"
* **Permission Error**: Bot or moderator lacks `BAN_MEMBERS`
* **General Error**: Error message with details

## Automatic vs Manual Unban

### Automatic Unbans

For temporary bans created with `/ban duration:<time>`:

* Bot automatically unbans at expiration
* Database automatically updated
* Audit log entry created
* No manual action needed

### Manual Unbans

Use `/unban` for:

* Appealed permanent bans
* Early release from temporary bans
* Correcting mistaken bans
* When automatic unban failed

## Related Commands

* [Ban](ban.md) - Ban a user (with optional duration)
* [Kick](kick.md) - Remove without ban
* [User Info](../utility/user-info.md) - View user's ban history
* [Warn](warn.md) - Issue warning

## Configuration

Uses audit log channel from `config.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "auditLog": "AUDIT_CHANNEL_ID"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

* **Review ban reason first** - Understand why they were banned
* **Check for pattern** - Look at full moderation history
* **Clear communication** - Explain expectations when unbanning
* **Document reason** - Be detailed about why unban was granted
* **Set conditions** - Make it clear this might be last chance
* **Team consensus** - Discuss major unbans with other moderators
* **Monitor after unban** - Watch for repeat behavior

## When to Unban

**Good Reasons:**

* Successful appeal with genuine remorse
* Temporary ban expired (if automatic unban failed)
* Ban was mistake or too harsh
* Significant time passed and user matured
* Extenuating circumstances came to light

**Proceed with Caution:**

* User hasn't shown understanding of rules
* Temporary ban hasn't expired yet (early release requested)
* User has history of repeat offenses
* Community strongly opposed
* User made no effort to appeal properly

## Appeal Process

Consider establishing:

1. **Appeal Form** - Standard questions for ban appeals
2. **Review Period** - Time moderators discuss
3. **Requirements** - What user must demonstrate
4. **Communication** - How to notify of decision
5. **Conditions** - Terms of unban (e.g., warning status)

## Tips

* Keep a log of all unban decisions and reasoning
* Consider implementing a probationary period after unban
* Make sure user has read and understood rules before unbanning
* Give users invite link after unbanning
* Welcome them back but set clear expectations
* Monitor their behavior closely after rejoining
* Have a "strike" system (e.g., "this is your final chance")
* Document any conditions attached to the unban

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Rage Ban

User was banned during heated moment, calmer review shows it was too harsh.

**Action**: Unban with apology, explain proper punishment

### Scenario 2: Time Served

User was permanently banned, but a year has passed and they've matured.

**Action**: Review appeal, unban with probation

### Scenario 3: Wrong Person

Accidentally banned user with similar name.

**Action**: Immediate unban, apologize, compensate if appropriate

### Scenario 4: Rules Changed

User was banned for rule that no longer exists or was clarified.

**Action**: Review all similar bans, unban if appropriate

## Post-Unban Monitoring

After unbanning:

* Watch their messages for first 24-48 hours
* Check if they engage positively with community
* See if they follow rules they previously broke
* Be ready to re-ban quickly if necessary
* Document behavior for future reference
