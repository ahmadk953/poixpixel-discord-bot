## How It Works

### Submission Process

1. **User submits fact** via `/fact submit`
2. **Fact enters pending state** (unless submitted by admin)
3. **Notification sent** to fact approval channel
4. **Moderators review** using interactive buttons or `/fact approve`
5. **Approved facts** enter the pool for daily posting

### Approval Workflow

When a fact is submitted:

* An embed is posted in the configured fact approval channel
* Moderators see "Approve" and "Reject" buttons
* Clicking buttons immediately approves/rejects the fact
* Alternatively, use `/fact approve` or `/fact delete` commands with fact ID

### Daily Posting (Automatic)

The bot automatically posts facts based on schedule:

* **Scheduled time**: Configured in bot settings
* **Random selection**: Picks from approved, unused facts
* **Posted to**: Configured fact channel
* **Tracking**: Marks facts as posted to avoid repeats

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Submit a Fact

```bash
/fact submit content:The Great Wall of China is over 13,000 miles long source:National Geographic
```

Submit an interesting fact with a source.

### Example 2: Submit Without Source

```bash
/fact submit content:Octopuses have three hearts
```

Submit a fact without specifying a source.

### Example 3: Approve a Pending Fact

```bash
/fact approve id:42
```

Approve fact #42 to add it to the pool.

### Example 4: View Pending Facts

```bash
/fact pending
```

See all facts waiting for approval with pagination.

### Example 5: Delete an Inappropriate Fact

```bash
/fact delete id:15
```

Remove fact #15 from the database.

### Example 6: Manually Post a Fact

```bash
/fact post
```

Immediately post a random approved fact (admin only).

## Configuration

Configure fact channels in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "factOfTheDay": "FACT_CHANNEL_ID",
    "factApproval": "APPROVAL_CHANNEL_ID"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

* `factOfTheDay` - Channel where approved facts are posted
* `factApproval` - Channel where pending facts await moderator review

## Interactive Buttons

The fact approval system uses Discord buttons:

* **Approve Button** (Green) - Approves the fact immediately
* **Reject Button** (Red) - Deletes the fact immediately

These buttons are attached to fact submission notifications in the approval channel.

## Tips for Users

* **Be accurate** - Double-check your facts before submitting
* **Provide sources** - Sources help moderators verify accuracy
* **Keep it appropriate** - Facts should follow server rules
* **Stay interesting** - Unique and surprising facts are more likely to be approved

## Tips for Moderators

* **Check sources** - Verify facts are accurate before approving
* **Use `/fact pending`** regularly to stay on top of submissions
* **Be consistent** - Apply the same approval standards to all submissions
* **Use delete for inappropriate** content, not just incorrect facts
* **Interactive buttons** are faster than commands for quick approvals

## Database Schema

Facts are stored with:

* Unique ID
* Content
* Source (optional)
* Submitter user ID
* Approved status (boolean)
* Posted status (boolean)
* Submission timestamp
