## Giveaway Builder

### Step 1: Basic Information

The modal collects:

- **Prize**: Name of the prize (required)
- **Winners**: Number of winners (default: 1)
- **Duration**: How long it runs (e.g., "7d", "48h", "30m")
- **Description**: Additional information about the giveaway

### Step 2: Requirements (Optional)

Eligibility criteria participants must meet:

- **Required Roles**: Specific roles users must have
- **Excluded Roles**: Roles that disqualify users
- **Minimum Level**: Required XP level
- **Minimum Messages**: Required message count
- **Account Age**: Minimum Discord account age
- **Server Join Date**: How long they've been in the server

### Step 3: Bonus Entries (Optional)

Give extra entries to users with:

- **Bonus Roles**: Specific roles grant extra entries
- **Level Milestones**: Higher levels get more entries
- **Message Milestones**: Active users get more entries

## Entry System

### How to Enter

Users enter by clicking the ðŸŽ‰ button on the giveaway message.

### Entry Validation

When a user clicks to enter:

1. **Requirements checked**: System verifies all eligibility criteria
2. **Feedback provided**: User receives confirmation or rejection reason
3. **Entry recorded**: Eligible users are added to participants list
4. **Bonus applied**: Extra entries calculated based on bonuses

### Entry Calculation

```text
Total Entries = 1 (base) + Role Bonuses + Level Bonuses + Message Bonuses
```

**Example:**

- User has "Booster" role (+2 entries)
- User is Level 15 (+1 entry for Level 10+)
- User has 500 messages (+1 entry for 500+)
- **Total: 5 entries**

## Winner Selection

### Selection Process

1. **Pool creation**: All eligible participants with their entry counts
2. **Weighted random**: More entries = higher chance
3. **Duplicate prevention**: Same user can't win multiple times
4. **Validation**: Ensures winners still meet requirements

### Winner Announcement

When giveaway ends:

- Original message updated to show "ENDED"
- Winners announced with mentions
- Host notified
- Entry count displayed
- Jump button to giveaway added

### If No Valid Winners

If there aren't enough eligible participants:

- Announces available winners (even if less than target)
- Explains in the message
- Giveaway still marked as ended

## Usage Examples

```bash
/giveaway create

## Configuration

Configure Community Manager role in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "roles": {
    "staffRoles": [
      {
        "name": "Community Manager",
        "roleId": "YOUR_ROLE_ID_HERE"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Interactive Elements

### Giveaway Message Components

- **ðŸŽ‰ Enter Button**: Click to enter the giveaway
- **Embed**: Shows prize, host, end time, requirements, bonuses
- **Footer**: Shows entry count and giveaway ID

### Builder Interface

- **Modals**: For text input (prize, duration, description)
- **Select Menus**: For role selection (when <25 roles)
- **Pagination**: For listing many giveaways

## Best Practices

### For Hosts

- **Clear prize descriptions**: Be specific about what you're giving away
- **Reasonable durations**: 24h-7d is typical
- **Fair requirements**: Don't make it too hard to enter
- **Appropriate bonus entries**: Balance advantage without being unfair
- **Timely winner contact**: DM winners promptly after selection

### For Participants

- Check requirements before entering
- Enable DMs so hosts can contact you if you win
- Respond promptly if selected as a winner
- Don't spam the enter button (multiple clicks don't help!)

Giveaways are stored with:

- Unique ID
- Prize details
- Host ID and channel/message IDs
- Start and end timestamps
- Winner count
