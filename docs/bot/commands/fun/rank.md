## How It Works

1. **User Lookup**: Fetches the specified user's data from the database (or command author's data if no user specified).

2. **Level Calculation**: Retrieves current level and XP from the leveling system.

3. **XP Calculation**: Calculates XP needed for the next level using the leveling formula.

4. **Card Generation**: Generates a custom image with:
   * User avatar
   * Username
   * Level badge
   * XP progress bar
   * Themed background

5. **Display**: Sends the generated rank card as an image attachment.

## Leveling System

The XP and leveling system works as follows:

* **XP Gain**: Users earn XP by sending messages (configurable min/max per message)
* **XP Cooldown**: Cooldown between XP gains (default: 60 seconds)
* **Level Formula**: XP required increases with each level
* **Level Roles**: Automatic role assignment at specific level thresholds (if configured)

### XP Requirements

The XP needed for each level increases progressively. The formula used ensures balanced progression that rewards active participation.

## Configuration

Configure the leveling system in `config.json`:

{
  "leveling": {
    "enabled": true,
    "minXpAwarded": 15,
    "maxXpAwarded": 25,
    "xpCooldown": 60000
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

* `enabled` - Enable/disable the leveling system
* `minXpAwarded` - Minimum XP per message
* `maxXpAwarded` - Maximum XP per message
* `xpCooldown` - Cooldown between XP gains (milliseconds)

## Tips

* Send messages regularly to gain XP (respecting the cooldown)
* Check your rank to see how close you are to leveling up
* Level roles may be assigned automatically at certain milestones
* The rank card uses custom fonts and styling for a polished look
