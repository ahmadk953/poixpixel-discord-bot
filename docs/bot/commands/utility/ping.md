# Ping Command

## Overview

The `/ping` command is a simple utility to check the bot's responsiveness and measure the latency between you and the bot.

## Command Details

### Permissions Required

* **User**: No special permissions (available to everyone)
* **Bot**: `SEND_MESSAGES`

### Command Syntax

```bash
/ping
```

No parameters required.

## Features

### 1. **Latency Measurement**

Calculates the time between:

* When you send the command
* When the bot responds

### 2. **Health Check**

Quick way to verify:

* Bot is online and responding
* Bot can read and respond to commands
* Connection is stable

## Usage Example

```bash
/ping
```

**Response:**

```text
üèì Pong! Latency: 125ms
```

## How It Works

1. **Interaction Received**: Bot receives your slash command

2. **Timestamp Calculation**:
   * Records current timestamp
   * Compares with interaction creation timestamp
   * Calculates difference in milliseconds

3. **Response**: Sends message with latency measurement

## Interpreting Results

### Latency Ranges

| Latency | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| < 100ms | Excellent | Very fast response |
| 100-200ms | Good | Normal response time |
| 200-500ms | Fair | Noticeable delay |
| > 500ms | Poor | Significant lag |

### Factors Affecting Latency

* **Discord API response time** - Discord's server load
* **Bot server location** - Geographic distance
* **Your connection** - Your internet speed
* **Bot load** - How busy the bot is
* **Network congestion** - Internet traffic

## Use Cases

* **Quick check**: Verify bot is online
* **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose connection issues
* **Benchmarking**: Compare performance over time
* **Fun**: Just say hi to the bot!

## Tips

* High latency doesn't always mean the bot is slow - could be Discord or your connection
* Run ping a few times to get average latency
* Compare with other bots to identify if issue is specific to this bot
* If latency is consistently high, report to bot administrator

## Differences from Network Ping

This is NOT the same as network ping:

* **Not ICMP**: Doesn't use network ping protocol
* **Application level**: Measures Discord interaction round-trip
* **Includes processing**: Bot processing time is included
* **Discord API**: Goes through Discord's API layer

For true network latency to bot server, use system ping tools with the bot's host IP (if available).
