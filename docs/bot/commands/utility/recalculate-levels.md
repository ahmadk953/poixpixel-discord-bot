# Recalculate Levels Command

## Overview

The `/recalculate-levels` command recalculates all user levels based on their current XP. This is useful after changing leveling formulas or fixing XP/level discrepancies.

## Command Details

### Permissions Required

- **User**: `ADMINISTRATOR` permission
- **Bot**: `SEND_MESSAGES`

### Command Syntax

```bash
/recalculate-levels
```

No parameters required. Response is ephemeral.

## Features

### 1. **Full Recalculation**

- Processes all users in database
- Recalculates levels from XP
- Updates database records
- Applies new leveling formula

### 2. **Bulk Operation**

- Handles all users at once
- Efficient database updates
- Progress reporting

### 3. **Formula Application**

- Uses current leveling formula
- Ensures consistency
- Fixes discrepancies

## Usage Example

```bash
/recalculate-levels
```

Bot will:

1. Acknowledge command
2. Process all user records
3. Recalculate levels
4. Update database
5. Report completion

## When to Use

**Use recalculate-levels after:**

- Changing XP-to-level formula
- Database migrations
- Importing user data
- Fixing bulk XP errors
- System updates
- Formula bugs

**Not needed for:**

- Individual XP adjustments (automatic)
- Normal XP gains (automatic)
- Single user corrections

## How It Works

1. **Fetch All Users**: Retrieves all user records from database
2. **Calculate Levels**: Applies leveling formula to each user's XP
3. **Update Database**: Updates level values in batch
4. **Role Updates**: Triggers level role assignments if needed
5. **Completion**: Reports success

## Processing Time

Depends on user count:

- **< 100 users**: Few seconds
- **100-1000 users**: 10-30 seconds
- **1000+ users**: 30-60+ seconds

## Related Commands

- [XP](xp.md) - Manually adjust XP
- [Rank](../fun/rank.md) - View user level
- [Leaderboard](../fun/leaderboard.md) - View rankings

## Use Cases

- **Formula changes**: After modifying leveling algorithm
- **Data corrections**: Fix inconsistencies
- **Migrations**: After importing data
- **Auditing**: Verify level accuracy
- **Maintenance**: Periodic recalculation

## Best Practices

- **Backup first**: Export database before recalculating
- **Off-peak**: Run during low activity
- **Test formula**: Verify formula is correct first
- **Announce**: Warn users levels may change
- **Monitor**: Check logs for errors

## Post-Recalculation

After running:

- Verify random sample of users with `/rank`
- Check leaderboard for consistency
- Monitor for user reports of issues
- Review logs for errors
- Document what changed

## Tips

- Run after any leveling system changes
- Test on staging/dev environment first
- Keep users informed about level changes
- Consider running weekly/monthly for consistency
- Log old vs new levels for review
- Be prepared to explain level changes to users

## Technical Details

The recalculation uses the same formula as normal XP gains:

```typescript
level = calculateLevelFromXP(xp);
```

This ensures consistency between natural progression and recalculated levels.
