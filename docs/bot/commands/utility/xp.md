## Features

* **Immediate effect**: Changes apply instantly
* **Level recalculation**: Levels are automatically updated based on new XP
* **Flexible deltas**: Accepts any integer delta (positive or negative). The command does not enforce non-negative totals â€” totals may become negative. This will be fixed in a future update.
* **No audit logging**: Changes are not currently sent to an audit channel or audit log by this command. This will be implemented in a future update.

## Use Cases

* **Rewards**: Give bonus XP for events or contests
* **Corrections**: Fix XP errors or bugs
* **Penalties**: Remove XP for rule violations
* **Testing**: Set specific XP values for testing
* **Fresh starts**: Reset XP after server restructure

## Related Commands

* [Rank](../fun/rank.md) - View user's current XP and level
* [Leaderboard](../fun/leaderboard.md) - See top XP earners
* [Recalculate Levels](recalculate-levels.md) - Recalculate all levels

## Best Practices

* **Document changes**: Keep records of manual XP adjustments
* **Be fair**: Use consistently across all members
* **Communicate**: Explain to users why XP was changed
* **Use sparingly**: Don't manually adjust often (undermines earning system)
* **Consider alternatives**: Achievements or roles might be better for rewards

## Tips

* Use `add` for bonuses and rewards
* Use `remove` for minor corrections
* Use `set` for major corrections or specific targets
* Use `reset` for fresh starts or serious penalties
* Check current XP with `/rank` before adjusting
* Consider using `/recalculate-levels` after bulk changes
